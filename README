These are the most recent versions of the Nimbus family of fonts from URW++
released under the GPL.

	Nimbus Roman No9 L
	Nimbus Sans L
	Nimbus Mono

They are fully metric compatible with Times, Helvetica and Courier and support
the full WGL4 character set (and most of W1G, missing only the interrobang and
some subscript and superscript symbols).
